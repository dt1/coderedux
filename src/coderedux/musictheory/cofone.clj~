   [:p [:b "Introduction: "] "The goal of this series to learn how to derive and encode all of music theory. While this is partly a programmer-centric series, you don't have to understand a single line of code to understand what is happening here. In fact, I strongly encourage programmers to read the article then examine the code."]
   
   [:p.notes [:b "About the Code: "] "The code is written in Python, but anyone
who can program should be able to get the idea of what is happening.
For the Pythonistas reading this: I'm not attempting to get a Turing
Award or win points for elegance. I'm only looking for simplicity and
easy to understand. I don't make any pretenses about my coding prowess
and abilities. This is, first and foremost, about music theory. With that said..."]

   
   [:p "Before we get started, we have to make sure we have a few terms straight:"]

   [:p.notes [:b "Note: "] "A note is a single letter that represents a sound. If I play a C note, I am  playing one individual note. This definition will be expanded on in later articles, but for right now, just consider a note one single sound. You may have been exposed to basic singing lessons in grade school choir. A note would be singing \"Doe\" and stopping there."]

   [:p.notes [:b "Scale: "] "A scale is a group of notes. Going back to the grade school choir example, a scale would be singing the entire SolfÃ¨ge: \"Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti, Do\""]

   [:p.notes [:b "Keys: "] "I use the word 'Keys' often in this article. For the purpose of this article 'keys' is interchangeable with 'scales.' It is useful to get used to both words. We'll distinguish the meanings in a later article."]

   [:h2 "Deriving The Circle of Fifths: The Major Keys"]

   [:p "Many  books or lessons begin by starting with the Circle of Fifths. The Circle of Fifths is important because it represents the very foundation of many ideas in music theory, but nearly without fail, the missing exercise is the derivation of the Circle. How would anyone be able to learn the power of the Circle if she doesn't know how to derive it? I believe the answer to this question is \"she cannot\" and I think you will agree with me by the time you are finished reading this article."]

   [:p "In this article, I will show you how to derive the major scales of the Circle of Fifths. I won't do the minor scales today because this article will be too long and I don't want anyone begging for TL;DR, which I refuse to do. The next article will derive the minor keys. However, if you work through this article, you'll probably be able to derive the minor keys yourself."]

   [:h3 "Postulates"]

   [:p "For those who have worked through high school geometry, you'll remember that there were a few postulates created by Euclid which were used to derive all of Euclidean Geometry. For those who don't know or remember what a postulate is:"
    [:dl
     [:dt [:b "Postulate"]]
     [:dd "&sect; to assume or claim as true, existent, or necessary"]
     [:dd "&sect; depend upon or start from the postulate of"]
     [:dd "&sect; to assume as a postulate or axiom (as in logic or mathematics)" ]]
    "In order to begin the derivation of the Circle of Fifths, and all of music theory, some things have to be taken for granted as true."]

   [:p.notes [:b "Note: "] "I am being a tad irresponsible by stating we are deriving all of music theory. To be clear, our focus is strictly on modern Western music. The history of our current theory is fascinating and I'll get into this in another article. If you're so inclined, you can research this yourself."]

   [:p "Let's start by creating the postulates ourselves. Here is a picture of a few piano keys with their names: "]

   (image "/img/pianoWithFlats.png")

   [:p "I'm using a piano because it is the easiest illustration of the layout of the notes. For those who are not pianists, fear not. I'm a guitarist and I can't even play \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" on the piano."]

   [:p "If you look at the black keys, you'll see that each of them have two names: sharps and flats. The notes go in ascending order from C to B, then start over again. If you were to extend the piano to its full 88 keys, the pattern would repeat itself. Each sharp note is to the right of the natural note, and each flat note is to the left of the natural note. Right now, we don't need the flat notes. We'll come back to them later, I promise, but to make the first step of the project as easy as possible, we'll remove the flat notes:"]

   (image "/img/pianoWithNoFlats.png")

   [:p "Let me point out another interesting thing before continuing on. Take note how the C note is always to the left of two black keys, and the F is to the left of three black keys. This pattern will allow us to generalize the patterns needed to create the Circle of Fifths."]

   [:p.notes [:b "Postulate Number One: "] "The key of C Major is all the white keys of the piano."]

   [:p "I started the piano on the C note. This is not an accident or random decision. The Key of C Major is the foundation of music theory because it is the easiest to play, the easiest to see, and it reveals a pattern that allows the next  postulate to make sense."]

   [:p.notes [:b "Postulate Number Two: "] "If there is a black key between two neighboring natural notes, the distance between the natural notes is one Step. If there is no black key between two neighboring  natural notes, the distance between the natural notes is one Half Step."]

   [:p "Lets refer back to the piano. If we consider the notes in the key of C Major, we'll see that the Half Step only exists between B &amp; C and E &amp; F. The distance between all of the other keys is One Step. We can use this fact to understand the next postulate:"]

   [:p.notes [:b "Postulate Number Three: "] "The pattern of the C Major scale can be used to derive " [:i "all "] "of the major scales."]

   [:p "The pattern starts at C and ends at C, giving us Step - Step - Half Step - Step - Step - Step - Half Step:"]

   (image "/img/keyPattern.png")

   [:h3 "Generating the Major Keys"]

   [:p [:b "Step One: "] "With our postulates in place, we can begin generating the major keys. Start by grabbing a sheet of paper. It would probably help to use a lined sheet of paper and writing on it sideways so you can keep the notes lined up."]

   [:p [:b "Step Two: "] "On the top of the paper, write the pattern we established: S, S, H, S, S, S, H"]

   [:p [:b "Step Three: "] "Under the pattern, write all of the notes, starting at C, two times: C C# D D# E F F#  G G# A A# B C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B C"]

   [:p [:b "Step Four: "] "Down the left, side, write all the notes, starting at C, and ending at B."]

   [:p [:b "Step Five: "] "Create one extra column called \"Sharps\""]

There is something revealing about this process and it's important you pay attention."]

The wonderful thing here is that once you understand the Circle of Fifths, at least to this point, you can see how it becomes an excellent memorization tool. By using nothing more than a pencil and paper, a bit of math, and not knowing how to read music at all, the Circle of Fifths has already generated the first 6 notes. The Fifth Note of the C Major Scale is indeed G, the Fifth Note of the  G Major Scale is D, the Fifth Note of D Major is A. This pattern will continue all around the Circle of Fifths."]

   [:p "Now we have to do a little bit of thinking and look at the situation. We know that B has 5 sharps, and we have counted from 0 sharps. This means that we would want to find a key with 6 sharps now. If we look at the numbers, we can see that there are no contenders... or is there?"]

   [:p "Then let's do it:"]

   [:p "Chew on this fact for a moment: There is nothing in Music Theory that states neighboring notes separated by Half Steps can't be sharpened or flattened. This means that E can actually become E#, effectively becoming F. B can also become B#, effectively becoming C. This can happen despite the fact that there is no key on the piano explicitly representing B# or E#. The only goal is to be sure that each key reads A B C D E F G."]

   [:p "With the above knowledge,  we can add one or two sharps to the scales to find scales that have 6 and 7 sharps. There are only two keys where this is possible, since they both have 5 sharps listed: C# and F#. So, let's see what happens:"]

   [:p.notes [:b "C# is C# D# F F# G# A# C. "] "If we convert the extra C to B# (we can't change C# because the Key of C# must have C# somewhere in it), we end up with C# D# E# F# G# A# B# for a total of 7 sharps."]
   [:p.notes [:b "F# is F# G# A# B C# D# F "] "We do have an extra F, so why not turn that into E#, which gives us F# G# A# B C# D# E# for a total of 6 sharps."]

   [:p "And notice now how all of the patterns we've seen so far have been maintained. One sharp has been added, each key keeps all the sharps from the previous keys, and the new sharp is one note below the new key's named note. And yes, the fifth of B is F# and the fifth of F# is C#."]

   [:p "We can now suspect that  Bb must be the fifth of Eb now, which it is. But what about F? Should it be converted to a flat as well? No!

   [:p "We're not quite done yet, but we can complete the Circle. We know the key of C# has 7 sharps. Shouldn't there be a key that has 7 flats? The Circle of Fifths is supposed to show the relationship between all scales and all the notes."]

We have yet to discover the Flat Scales with 5, 6, and 7 flats. Fortunately, this part is easily done with a bit of common sense. We know that Ab has 4 flats, so perhaps to the right of it, there is room for a key with 5 flats. C# is already occupying that spot, right? Yes it is, but we know from our prior exercises that C# is equivalent to Db. We can also look at A Major on the right side of the circle and see that D Major sits next to it, so there are two pieces of evidence that lets us know that Db should sit next to Ab. It turns out that Db does in fact have 5 flats. We can also do the same process for Gb, which shares a spot with F#, and Cb, which shares a Spot with B:
