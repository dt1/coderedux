   [:h3 "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"]
   [:small "By Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman"]

   [:p "SICP is the first book I read on programming that mattered, and to date, I haven't read a book that hits with the same power. When I talk to someone who experienced this book (reading it doesn't do it justice), he or she will often mention going back to it for a second look."]

   [:p "The book and the accompanying videos deserve every bit of praise heaped on it. Even though it was written back in the 1980s, the concepts taught are still relevant today, and in fact, many “new ideas” such as MapReduce and functional programming were laid out in that book. Rather than think of these ideas as new, I think of them as rediscovered, or perhaps long-overdue for wide acceptance."]

   [:p "To get the main misconceptions out of the way, the book isn't about Lisp, nor is it a book about functional programming. Yes, Abelson and Sussman are shamelessly pro-Lisp and they do promote the idea of functional programming as superior to object oriented programming, but they do not spend much time on these topics. Many people tend to miss the fact that they mercilessly cut into functional programming, and they take no prisoners when bashing into recursion, despite the book's reputation as a book on recursion."]

   [:p "SICP is, first and foremost, a love story to programming, embracing all of programming's warts and quirks. It is a book about building systems, and thinking about the world in abstractions. Whether you are a lone programmer or a programmer working on a large team, the contract is the same: approach programming as layers of small abstractions."]

   [:p "To get the most out of this book, it is helpful to watch the lectures, but you must try your best to get through all of the exercises. This isn't a passive reading book, and the true gems are found through self-discovery. I often found myself solving a problem and just sitting back, mind blown and thinking about the ramifications of what I just learned, and it was all the more potent because I “discovered” it myself, with a healthy nudge. I'll be the first to admit that I couldn't get through all of the exercises, but what I did were valuable and still affect my thinking to this day."]

   [:p "The final misconception, derived from the idea that SICP is a “book on Lisp,” is that you can substitute any popularly known Lisp, such as Clojure, or “Lisp-like” language for the book. I believe this is wrong, as Scheme is a minimal language that goes well with the book's intent to have you explore programming concepts with minimal distraction. Using a language like Clojure takes aways so much of intention the book. For example, you are to build your own maps and your own object system, and as Clojure provides all of these for you (with maps and atoms), you are only cheating yourself. The idea is to learn about abstractions and working with abstractions by building these abstractions yourself, whether that abstraction is a table or a register machine."]

   [:p "If you are a self-learner, expect to take your time with this book. It isn't an easy book to get through, especially without guidance. My main advice is, once you decide to start, commit yourself to seeing it through to the end. Take time out of each day to do code something and the book will be completed. Trust me, it is worth every bit of effort."]
